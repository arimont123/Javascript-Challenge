# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

This code creates a table dynamically based upon a dataset (StarterCode/static/js/data.js). It allows users to filter the table data for specific values. The assignment was completed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.

## Your Task
### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, and wrote the code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * It has a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match users input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Completed all of Level 1 criteria.

* Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
